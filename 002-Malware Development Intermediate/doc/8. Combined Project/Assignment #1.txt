
In VCsniff use other hooking methods:

    IAT hooks
    in-line patching


Modify VCpersist:

    obfuscate all clear text strings
    change all calls to external functions into dynamically resolved calls (via pointer and GetProcAddress/GetModuleHandle)


Is it possible to create VCpesist as a No-Imports binary?
